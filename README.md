## House Price prediction

Hi Friends!
This project was done through Google Colab. 
The main aim of the project is to predict the prices of houses in and around the city of Chennai, India, based on an the available datasets provided by a Client. Two situations were taken into consideration, wherein, in the first case, only the Built up area of the house is available and in the second case, several features were given like Area, Distance from Main Road, Number of Bedrooms, Bathrooms, etc. 
Hence, we have provided a solution to predict the House price in both the above situations - A univariate Model and a Multivariate Machine Learning Model. Both the model and Dataset are well sorted in their corresponding folders.
In case, you would like to predict the house price for a different city or country, you would have to find a dataset, containing the House price and then train the model. All you would have to do is, change the path of your dataset and also the pre-processing steps might differ according to the features of the dataset, depending on the Explonatory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Data. At this point you might have query on what is EDA or why EDA is necessary or is it necessary? -- Please read through this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@srimalashish/why-eda-is-necessary-for-machine-learning-233b6e4d5083) which answers this question or if you too lazy to read, do watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1deR1HdHIU) .
